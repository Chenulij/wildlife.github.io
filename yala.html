                <h2> <u> Introduction </u> </h2> 
              <p> Yala National Park (otherwise known as Ruhuna National Park) is one of Sri Lanka’s must-sees. Located to the south east of the island, this exceptional game reserve is Sri Lanka’s most popular for very good reason. Thought to be home to the greatest density of leopards per square kilometre in the world, Yala covers an area of 1,260 square kilometres and is divided into five blocks. Block I is the most visited portion of the reserve and the most rewarding destination for a leopard safari. Leopards are usually elusive, though in Yala, sightings of them are extremely good – you might see them basking in the sun atop rocky outcrops, in trees, crossing tracks and beside waterholes. Alongside leopards, there are also sloth bears, Asian elephants, deer, monkeys, buffalo and many species of birds. If you’re really set on seeing leopards, Yala will offer you Sri Lanka’s best opportunity.</p>

                <h2> <u> History </u> </h2> 
                <p> Yala is one of Sri Lanka’s oldest national parks and was designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back as 1900 though it wasn’t until 1938 that it was established as a national park. Right in the heart of Yala sits the Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, and this former monastery is thought to date back 2,000 years. At one time, the monastery is thought to have housed 12,000 inhabitants, and today, it remains an important temple visited by pilgrims across Sri Lanka. Other significant cultural sites in the vicinity include Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara.</p>

            <h2> <u> Location  </u> </h2> 
            <p> Yala National Park is located in the south east of Sri Lanka around 20km southwest of Tissamaharama. Part of the reserve borders the Indian Ocean. It takes less than 10-minutes to reach the entrance of the reserve from Chena Huts, which sits in the park’s wildlife-rich buffer zone. Colombo is around a 300-kilometre drive away, which takes five hours.</p>
